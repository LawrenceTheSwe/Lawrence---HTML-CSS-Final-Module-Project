Portfolio Landing Page

This portfolio landing page is designed to showcase my skills as a software engineer with a focus on clean UI, responsiveness, and modern web standards. The layout follows a dark, minimal, and futuristic aesthetic to keep the focus on content and usability.

The page features a responsive navigation bar, a hero section with a brief introduction and profile image, and a “Recent Work” section highlighting technologies and projects. The entire layout is built using HTML and CSS, with Flexbox and media queries ensuring a smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Key goals of this landing page:

Clean, readable structure with semantic HTML

Mobile-first responsiveness

Consistent spacing, alignment, and typography

A professional presentation suitable for employers and clients
